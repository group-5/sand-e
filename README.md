# **Sand.E** the sand art robot

## Description

The invention of the difference engine in 1833, came with it an entire new process of thought and development.
Since then, the field of computation and robotics has become one of the largest in the world.
It is a field that requires developers to suspend their usual way of thinking and instead look at tasks and problems as a computer.
These ways of thinking are not encountered in daily life.
Other intellectual and physical fields have their foundations discovered through juvenile interactions.
However, the ability to approach a task with an algorithmic method---a loop or conditional statements---is not naturally acquired.
These skills must therefore be taught through non-conventional means.
This could be as a teenager or adult, when first being confronted with programming; however, years of educational studies have shown that skills and understanding are much more easily acquired at an early age.
This is the motivation of the Sand.E project: to develop a method, useable by schools and parents, to begin to nurture programming skills in children.
The aim for this project is to develop a working prototype of a programmable, autonomous robot with the ability to draw large scale art in sand.
The robot will be able to accept a set of repeatable instructions from a student.
